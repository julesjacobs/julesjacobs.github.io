title: "You Don't Need Matrix Calculus"
---

[Matrix calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_calculus) pops up on social media from time to time, primarily due to the increased popularity of machine learning. It lets you differentiate functions of vector or matrix variables even if you are not a fan of automatic differentiation. It involves all kinds of complex rules, depending on whether your vectors are row or column vectors, and it gets even worse for matrices. Let's not even speak of tensors.

Fortunately, there is a **much** better way to do this, which physicists figured out decades ago when they started to work with tensors: just write out the scalars and use ordinary differentiation.
