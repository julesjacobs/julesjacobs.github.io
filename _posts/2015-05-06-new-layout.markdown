The new layout is a stripped down the default Jekyll layout. I've deemphasized everything that's not main content, and I've changed the typography according to <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/11/04/best-practices-of-combining-typefaces/">Best Practices of Combining Typefaces</a>. My design sense and skill is unfortunately not great, so if you have any tips that would be greatly appreciated.
