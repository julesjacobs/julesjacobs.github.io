title:  "Math puzzle: how many coins do you need to toss to maximise the probability of getting 10 heads?"
---

If you throw less than 10 coins, then the probability of getting 10 heads is zero. If you throw 10 coins then the probability is (1/2)^10. If you throw a million coins then the probability of getting exactly 10 heads is very small. How many coins do you throw to maximise the probability of getting exactly 10 heads?

It's not difficult, but can you give an intuitive argument?
