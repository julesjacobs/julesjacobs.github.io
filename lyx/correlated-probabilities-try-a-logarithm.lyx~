\begin_layout Title
Correlated probabilities? Try a logarithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we have a patient and are trying to determine whether his leg
 is broken.
 A general practitioner investigates the patient and a radiologist looks
 at a scan of his leg.
 Both doctors give their conclusion in the form of a probability that the
 leg is broken, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{GP}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 How do we combine these probabilities into one? If these were independent
 then we could just multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{GP}\cdot P_{R}$
\end_inset

, it's likely that both the GP and the radiologist will have the same opinion,
 so they are not independent.
 Furthermore, maybe the opinion of the radiologist is more accurate than
 the opinion of the general practitioner, because the radiologist looks
 at a scan of the leg.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could forget that these are probabilities altogether, and focus on the
 decision of whether to operate the patient or not.
 We assign a combined score 
\begin_inset Formula $f(P_{GP},P_{R})$
\end_inset

 in some way, and then look empirically for a decision boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $f(P_{GP},P_{R})<\alpha$
\end_inset

 that gives us a trade-off between the false positive and false negative
 rate.
 The question remains which 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 we should use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A linear model is usually the first you'd try, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(P_{GP},P_{R})=aP_{GP}+bP_{R}$
\end_inset

, but I claim that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(P_{GP},P_{R})=P_{GP}^{a}\cdot P_{R}^{b}$
\end_inset

 is more natural.
 If the probabilities were independent then 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1,b=1$
\end_inset

 would give 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{GP}\cdot P_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Choosing different 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 weighs the opinions, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=1/3$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b=2/3$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is equivalent to training a linear model on the log probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $\log P_{GP}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\log P_{R}$
\end_inset

, because 
\begin_inset Formula $\log(P_{GP}^{a}\cdot P_{R}^{b})=a\log P_{GP}+b\log P_{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The log probability is natural from the point of view of information theory:
 log probability is measured in bits.
 Probabilities get multiplied, bits get added.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're training a classifier on probabilities, try a logarithm.
